# AssetVerifierDiscordBot
This is a bot you can run on Discord to verify invoices from users when they send their invoice or order number via DM to the bot.

You need to host the code on replit, and use uptimerobot to ping it so it stays online and replit wont auto-close it after x hours.

When a user sends a DM to the bot with a valid invoice number it will assign it a role in your server. You can manage permissions of that role to restrict access to specific channels, or support channels altogether. Whatever you see fit to do with it.

More credits, details and comments are in the source code.
